When lifted morning mist
A haughty figure came from wood to list
He’d come from the desolation
When he’d heard the invocation
Let others choose the tree of shields
Whatever combat he’d never yield
A joust à plaisance ou à la guerre
Blood would be tasted on the air
From Dover to Land’s End
Plymouth to Hadrian's Wall 
None could take him from his steed so tall
Peering through the helm was a man thick as elm 
Sturdy as an oak in rusted armour; mail cloaked
No matter the crests of these knaves 
Of over a dozen banners that waved
In view of lourdes and ladies
They’d all be sent to the gates of Hades
Wolfric the Wild approaches the tilt
Giving salutations with his hilt
The crowd did rant and rave
When their champion’s helmet was caved
Winking to the ladies in the berfrois
He gave the bastard his coup de grâce
Wiping a brow that did perspire
He called for a drink from his dwarven squire
Drunken with bloodlust divine
He laid his sight on a wench so fine
No matter if his breath reeked of wine and ale
When a champion was made then that night he’d prevail
To hell with the pageantry and gallantry
He was come for the pleasure itself
If the king and the land are to be one
By another knight's hand it should been done
